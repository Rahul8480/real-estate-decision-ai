# Real Estate Decision Intelligence AI

## Purpose
This project builds a daily autonomous AI system that generates real estate decision intelligence using only public, legal, and ethical data sources.

The AI focuses on:
- Identifying undervalued micro-markets
- Detecting early risk signals for builders and buyers
- Analyzing infrastructure-led price movements

## Core Principles
- No private or illegal data usage
- Human-in-the-loop oversight
- Explainable reasoning for every insight
- Memory of past predictions and outcomes

## Phase Roadmap
### Phase 1: Manual Intelligence (Current)
- Human-curated data
- Daily market observations
- Decision memory creation

### Phase 2: Assisted Intelligence
- Automated public data ingestion
- Retrieval-augmented reasoning
- Self-critique mechanisms

### Phase 3: Autonomous Intelligence
- Daily self-running analysis loop
- Risk and opportunity scoring
- Decision brief generation

## Long-Term Vision
To evolve this system into a trusted real estate intelligence layer that improves decision-making quality across the real estate ecosystem.
